11. antinutrients (interfere with absorption/use of nutrients)

	- strong reducing acids (oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid) 
		- can have antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing them from being absorbed

	- Phytic acid (nuts, seeds, grains)
		- has a strong binding affinity to minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc

	- Protease inhibitors: inhibit the actions of trypsin, pepsin and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein

	- Lipase inhibitors: interfere with enzymes, such as human pancreatic lipase, that catalyze the hydrolysis of some lipids, including fats. 

	- Amylase inhibitors (beans like white kidney beans): prevent the action of enzymes that break the glycosidic bonds of starches and other complex carbohydrates, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body

	- Oxalic acid/oxalates (rhubarb, tea, spinach, parsley and purslane): bind to calcium

	- Glucosinolates (broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, mustard greens, radishes, cauliflower): prevent the uptake of iodine, affecting the function of the thyroid and thus are considered goitrogens

	- Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of dietary fiber can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed
	- high calcium with iron can decrease the absorption of iron through inhibition of iron transport protein hDMT1

	- Some proteins can also be antinutrients
		- trypsin inhibitors and lectins found in legumes, which interfere with digestion
		- Avidin is an antinutrient found in active form in raw egg whites, which binds to biotin (vitamin B7), and can cause deficiency of B7

	- flavonoids, which are a group of polyphenolic compounds that include tannins, which chelate metals such as iron & zinc, reducing their absorption, & also inhibit digestive enzymes & precipitate proteins

	- Saponins in plants may act like antifeedants and can be classified as antinutrients 


	- antimetabolite: a chemical that inhibits the use of a metabolite
		- competitive inhibition: occurs with structural similarity between anti/metabolite (antifolates that interfere with the use of folic acid)
		- can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting cell growth and cell division
		- used to inhibit cell division/growth, as antibiotics, & decrease fibrosis

3. antifungal

	- compounds
		- Propidium iodide rapidly penetrated the majority of the yeast cells when the cells were treated with concentrations just over the MICs, 
		  meaning that the fungicidal effect resulted from an extensive lesion of the cell membrane
			- Clove oil and eugenol also caused a considerable reduction in the quantity of ergosterol, a specific fungal cell membrane component
			- Natamycin is able to inhibit growth of fungi by specifically binding to ergosterol present in fungal cell membranes. The molecule interacts irreversibly with the sterol forming a sandwich-like structure embedded in the hydrophobic core of the membrane; between the two lipid layers. This causes membrane fragmentation and indirectly affects the functions ergosterol takes part in, such as endocytosis and exocytosis, vacuole fusion, morphogenesis, and amino acid and glucose transport across the membrane
		- Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug, targets ergosterol. It binds physically to ergosterol within the membrane, thus creating a polar pore in fungal membranes. This causes ions (predominantly potassium and hydrons) and other molecules to leak out, which will kill the cell.
			- quercetin & rutin helped activity of & lessened side effects of amphotericin
		- Fluconazole, miconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole, and myclobutanil work in a different way, inhibiting synthesis of ergosterol from lanosterol by interfering with 14α-demethylase
		- Candicidin
		- Filipin – 35 carbons, binds to cholesterol (toxic)
		- Hamycin
		- Natamycin – 33 carbons, binds well to ergosterol
		- Nystatin
		- Rimocidin
		- berberine, caprylic acid, and undecylenic acid
		- garlic
			- In garlic supplements, vinyldithiins are only found in garlic oil macerates that are made by incubation of crushed garlic in oil
			- When a garlic clove is crushed, the enzyme alliinase is released forming allicin from the cysteine sulfoxide alliin. Allicin breaks down into additional organosulfur compounds. 
			- In the presence of oil or organic solvents, among the compounds formed are the isomeric vinyldithiins and ajoene
			- allinase, allicin, ajoene, vinyldithiin, thiosulfinate
			- ajoene is formed from a compound named allicin and an enzyme named allinase. When garlic is chopped or crushed, allicin and allinase come together to form the powerful antimicrobial agent ajoene.
		- betulinic: rosemary
		- ursolic: rosemary, thyme, holy basil, peppermint, apple peels
		- oleanolic: olive oil, garlic

		  - ylang ylang
		  - citronella/lemongrass, palmarosa, rose (geraniol) + aegle, geranium, patchouli, Eucalyptus, peppermint, Cinnamon
		  - Among phenolic compounds, thymol and carvacrol are most fungitoxic. 
		  - Terpenoids, citral, geraniol, and citronellol show best activities.
		  - finger root (Boesenbergia rotunda) 
		  	- Pinocembrin is in fingerroot (cerebral ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage, neurodegenerative diseases)
		  - limonene
		  - thyme (Thymus camphoratus and Thymus carnosus): thymol, p-cymene, myrcene, borneol, & linalool
		    - geraniol (LC50, 0.47 mg/ml) was the most toxic compound, 
		    followed by thymol (1.08 mg/ml), 
		    carvacrol (1.23 mg/ml) and 
		    terpinen-4-ol (2.61 mg/ml)

	- mechanism

		- The most common fungi to cause brain infections include filament-forming fungi like Aspergillus, Mucor and Rhizopus and yeast-type fungi such as Candida and Cryptococcus. 
		  Less common causes of fungal brain infections include Trichosporon, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides and Penicillium marneffei.

		- Drug treatment of fungal brain infections is complicated by the fact that many common antifungal drugs do not easily cross the blood-brain barrier. 
		  Some successes in treating fungal brain infections has been reported with the use of Amphotericin B, and some of the azole drugs such as Voriconazole and Posconazole. 
		  The newer Echinocandin drugs such as Caspofungin and Micafungin are very effective in treating brain infections caused by such fungi as Aspergillus and Candida, 
		  however they do not have good activity against some other fungi such as Cryptococcus, Mucor or Rhizopus.

		- Polyene antifungals
			- A polyene is a molecule with multiple conjugated double bonds. 
			- A polyene antifungal is a macrocyclic polyene with a heavily hydroxylated region on the ring opposite the conjugated system. 
			- This makes polyene antifungals amphiphilic. 
			- The polyene antimycotics bind with sterols in the fungal cell membrane, principally ergosterol. 
			- This changes the transition temperature (Tg) of the cell membrane, thereby placing the membrane in a less fluid, more crystalline state. 
			- In ordinary circumstances membrane sterols increase the packing of the phospholipid bilayer making the plasma membrane more dense.
			- As a result, the cell contents including monovalent ions (K+, Na+, H+, and Cl−), small organic molecules leak.
			- This is regarded one of the primary ways cell dies.
		- convert ergosterol to vitamin d
		- breaking fungal cell membranes by binding to ergosterol
		- change transition temperature of cell membrane in same way as polyene antifungal so that small organic molecules leak
		- Several anti-infectives (e.g., isoniazid, pyrazinamide, linezolid, metronidazole, fluconazole, and some fluoroquinolones) 
		  reach a CSF-to-serum ratio of the areas under the curves close to 1.0 and, therefore, are extremely valuable for the treatment of CNS infections
		- The polyene antimycotics bind with sterols in the fungal cell membrane, principally ergosterol
		- Azoles inhibit conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol by inhibition of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase

5. stimulate immune system


	- rules from https://www.nordicnaturals.com/healthy-science/5-supplements-to-boost-your-immune-system/

	  - immune function
	    Innate immune cells (such as macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells) 
	      serve as the body’s first line of defense against pathogens. 
	      are quick to respond to threats, innate immune cells carry out less specific responses to individual pathogens

	  - adaptive immune cells (namely T cells and B cells) 
	      are slower to respond but produce and respond to antibodies, which enables the immune system to remember past infections for future defense
	      B cells develop antibodies against the pathogens they encounter, which enable them to respond more efficiently during a second encounter
	      immune cells coordinate by secreting cytokines — molecules that attract other immune cells to the site of infection and regulate their activation or suppression

	  - glutamine
	      cell proliferation
	      respiratory fuel
	      enhance stimulated immune cell function
	      effect of extracellular glutamine concentration on lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production
	      macrophage phagocytic 
	      secretory activities 
	      neutrophil bacterial killing

	  - melatonin
	      increases in macrophage cells
	      increases in NK cells in the bone marrow
	      stimulated innate immune cell activity

	  - curcumin
	      enhance the responses of antibodies
	      promote the immune response of lymphocytes (white blood cells)
	      increase B cell proliferation in the intestines
	      reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines

	  - vitamin d
	    stimulating the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which are endogenous antibiotics (i.e., antibiotics that originate within an organism)

	  - probiotics
	      stimulate protective responses from intestinal epithelial cells
	      enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of NK cells in the spleen
	      induce the production of immunity-enhancing proteins in connective tissues
	      reinforce intestinal barrier integrity through increased gene expression
	      shift the composition of the gut toward specific beneficial bacteria

	  - eha/dha
	    synthesize potent signal molecules that help lower cell stress responses
	    regulate the activities of macrophage cells, which play a critical role in the body’s innate immune defense by patrolling for invading pathogens and working to eliminate them 
	    promote innate immune function
	      increasing the number and phagocytic capacity of neutrophil cells—a process (where the cell destroys a virus or infected cell by binding to it and engulfing it)
	    adaptive immune function
	      promoting the growth and specialization of certain types of T cells
	      increasing the number and percentages of B cell populations in different tissues

	- other rules:
	  - Dark leafy green vegetables, cauliflower, broccoli, squash, tomatoes, strawberries and carrots are all nutrient rich produce that may increase t-cells. 
	  - Folic acid, vitamin B 6, riboflavin and thiamin are particularly important to the proper functioning of t-cells and their quantity
