## Conditions


### I. diabetes 

	- treatments should include: 
		- amylase & glucosidase inhibitors (caffeoyl, galloyl, and prenyl groups)
		- berberine
		- carb blockers like white kidney bean extract
		- insulin
		- fasting
		- sweet defeat (sugar taste blockers)
		- as well as any compounds that can target the processes/receptors involved (ghrelin, metabolism, dopamine, GLUT-4 receptor) 

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- inhibit glucose absorption 
		- insulin-mimicking activity
		- enhanced glucose uptake
		- regulation of insulin signaling pathways
		- translocation of GLUT-4 receptor 
		- activation of the PPARγ


### II. fungal meningitis 

	- treatments should include:
		- carvacrol, thymol, eugenol
		- ecgc
		- inhibitors of CYP51 (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4)
		- alternate routes to cyp51 outputs: 
			- depletion of ergosterol and ergosta-7-enol
			- accumulation of eburicol, obtusifolione, and lanosterol/obtusifoliol
		- azole drugs
		- imidazoles
		- sertraline
		- insight path for serotonin-imidazole:
			- serotonin, which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids
			- amino acids are precursors to some alkaloids
			- some amino acids have synergistic effects to kill the pathogen (histidine, carnosine, lysine)
			- alkaloid-related substances as serotonin, dopamine and histamine are important neurotransmitters so may impact meningitis
			- alkaloids have imidazole ring 
			- imidazoles are a subset of azoles that have fewer side effects

		- should pull drugs & drug types (like statin/alkylamine/sterol enzyme/terpene) from studies mentioning alternative strategies like: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89924/

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- convert ergosterol to vitamin d
		- bind to ergosterol to break fungal cell membrane
		- any other substances that can bind with or permeate the fungal cell membrane or process ergosterol into something harmless
		- inhibit other links in chain allowing ergosterol to be constructed/protected:
			 "inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, squalene epoxide-lanosterol cyclase, lanosterol demethylase, Δ8 to Δ7 isomerase, and S-adenosylmethionine:sterol methyltransferase"

	- insights should include:
		- inhibits [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] in fungus but not mammals
		- inhibiting [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] prevents production of ergosterol from lanosterol & accumulation of [14α-methyl] sterols
		- ergosterol is a required input of the fungal cell membrane
		- breaking cell components [membranes] is a way to kill an organism
		- once you break the membrane, your system can handle the components of the cell
		- required inputs (enzymes) to inputs (ergosterol) of object components [cell membranes] are a key target to break those components
			(this insight should already exist in your insight db without those specifics)
		- some natural processes break cell membranes

		- Entry of anti-infectives into the central nervous system (CNS) depends on:
		  - the compartment studied, 
		  - molecular size, 
		  - electric charge, 
		  - lipophilicity, 
		  - plasma protein binding, 
		  - affinity to active transport systems at the blood-brain/blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, 
		  - host factors such as meningeal inflammation and CSF flow.

		- The ideal compound to treat CNS infections 
		  - is of small molecular size, 
		  - is moderately lipophilic, 
		  - has a low level of plasma protein binding, 
		  - has a volume of distribution of around 1 liter/kg
		  - is not a strong ligand of an efflux pump at the blood-brain or blood-CSF barrier

	- standard system analysis questions should include:
		- what are the limits of your system handling broken fungal cells?
		- does combination therapy work (convert ergosterol to vitamin d & prevent ergosterol production) without system damage?

	- drug attributes should include:
		- fungistatic
		- fungicidal (cryptococcus)
		- soluble in water & alcohol
		- stressor for kidneys
		- 90% excreted in urine & sweat, 10% metabolized


### III. cancer

	- relevant processes/attributes/systems:
		- communication, stressor distribution, & boundaries
		- immune system 
		- system & process error types

	- treatments should include:
		- anthrax for bladder cancer, salicylic acid (aspirin), AHCC, probiotics
		- stressors & handlers (change demand request & supply response matching)
		- known cancer drugs
		- hormone-reduction methods
		- ameliorative pathogen & microbe communities
		- metabolism (especially in blood sugar control & other fuels for cancer, as well as culling misfolded proteins), dietary enzymes
		- structural damage prevention (bind to toxins so theyre treated as fuel or not digested, tuning immune system to assume pathogens are hostile by default, tagging each new example encountered until its proven non-toxic using bio components as containers to form filters to allow testing, tuning immune system to gather & use the set of pathogen sub-components that will protect against all deadly pathogens)
		- immune system triggers
		- anti-inflammation triggers & similar triggers preventing excess unnecessary work of bio system like excess digestion
		- adjacent pathogens that can provide similar immunity
		- combinations/subsets & other structures of pathogens that can provide similar or equivalent immunity (wind blowing pieces of pathogens to form natural vaccine)
		- cell communication to prevent cancer from gathering (exercise, blood flow, oxygen absorption, deep breathing)
		- cell regeneration to cull compromised cells (exercise, cell proliferation/apoptosis triggers)
		- regulatory process triggers
		- neutralizing compounds to toxic chemicals (pollution, plastics, additives)

	- treatment strategies should include:
	  	- promote circulation in the organ (like caffeoquinone acid in the liver) to increasee cell communication, or push them to a place with greater blood flow or cell communication
	  	- identity set of stressors to activate helpful cell division
	  	- need a way to detect tumors using existing bio metrics
	  	- isolate tumors with a compound that they will interpret as the boundary of the host so they dont replicate further
	  	- make a list of anti-inflammatories & fit them to the stressor model
	  	- determine which organisms can borrow genes & look for link to cancer
	  	- determine the ratio of stress that optimizes learning without killing the host; ideally the solution would use the extra cell division potential to make useful cells
	  	- make a list of the common types of error the immune system makes (h pylori, cancer) & figure out if adjusting immune system function is the best layer to attack from
		- teach system to 'forget' previous misconfigurations with cell regeneration
		- teach system to function on various resource subsets with resource deprivation (fuel change, oxygen deprivation, environmental stress, nutrient-source variety)
		- stressor routing (apply cell stress to nearby or systemic components, like with massage to induce blood flow, weights to induce tissue repair)
		- reduce hormones that produce stressor-handler demand


### IV. Liver damage

	- assist liver/digestion

		- supplements
		  	- rosemary: cleans the blood & flushes harmful toxins from the liver, stimulates bile production & flow which aids digestion, may help liver problems (cirrhosis & jaundice)
		  	- german chamomile stimulates the liver & gall bladder which helps digestion & cleans the blood
		  	- peppermint stimulates bile flow from the liver & gall bladder & helps digestion
		  	- juniper: helps digestion, helps liver eliminate waste products

		  	- cypress, lemon and thyme oils help clear the liver
			- bethanechol can stimulate the nerves of the bladder, making them more responsive to stimulus
			- prelief is a dietary supplement that works as an acid blocker for the bladder
		  	- milk thistle
		  	- turmeric
		  	- bitter leafy greens such as dandelion, chicory and arugula also may promote liver function by reducing congestion because they stimulate bile flow
		  	- diuretics (celery, parsley, dandelion root, cucumber, asparagus, eggplant, watercress, artichokes and watermelon)
		  	- sulfur detoxifies medication substances, pesticides & other environmental toxins
		  		- foods rich in sulfur include onions, garlic & cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage & brussels sprouts)
		  		- the primary medicinal compound in garlic is called allicin, a strong antimicrobial that also deters infections
		  	- antioxidants eliminate free radicals, which reduce tissue damage & allow the organs & blood vessels to properly heal 
		  		- vitamins C & E, beta-carotene & flavonoids are powerful antioxidants found in citrus fruits, berries, dark-colored grapes, apples, tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, spinach & asparagus
		  		- vitamin C also helps to dissolve calcium buildup in the kidneys

	  	- calcium in moderation
	  	- coq10
	  	- carnitine
	  	- magnesium
	  	- green tea in moderation
	  	- Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker selectively block the activation of AT1 receptors, preventing the binding of angiotensin II compared to ACE inhibitors.[4] 
		    - Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker
		      - Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker main uses are in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage due to diabetes) and congestive heart failure. 
		      - may worsen kidney functions such as reducing glomerular filtration rate associated with a rise of serum creatinine
	    - ace inhibitor
	      - ACEi have been shown to decrease erythropoietin production, help kidney function
	      - Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone level
	      - ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium
	      - ACE inhibitors, but not for other RAAS blockers, is an increase in bradykinin level
	      - ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
	        - Reduced GFR is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an NSAID and a diuretic.
	          When the three drugs are taken together, the risk of developing renal failure is significantly increased.[20]
	    - angiotensin: a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. 
	      It is part of the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. 
	      Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex to promote sodium retention by the kidneys
	  	- beta blockers (reduce heart rate)
	  	- diuretic (fluid retention)
	  	- aldosterone antagonist
		- creatine, taurine, D-ribose
		- triptolide enhanced calcium restoration, curcumin inhibited ERK & p-STAT3 pathways, ginkolide B inhibited Ras/MAPK pathway, and steviol activated AMPK, which inhibited CFTR channel and mTOR pathway
