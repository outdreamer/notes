	I. essential oils

		- these are extremely concentrated & toxic, and small amounts can kill you - its always better to start with the source of the essential oil (the plant/substance containing it, if nontoxic/edible/inhalable or available in a topical form) rather than using to the concentrated oil itself

		- always look for alternatives before using these, use as little as possible if absolutely necessary & dilute heavily with water, using as few other supplements/nutrients as possible at the same time

	II. other substances listed may also be toxic & you should consult a nutritionist/scientist/doctor if you have any questions, like checking if you're using the right dose, to get specific custom advice for your health state

		- for example, both turmeric & fluconazole may damage your kidneys & liver at or above the recommended dose, like many other substances

	III. other substances may be toxic in the amounts/combinations you take them, but there are no studies on the toxic dose of that substance/combination, so you may have no warning

	IV. check all compounds for dosage & interactions given your health with your doctor to verify research interpretation

		1. if you add supplements, check the label, reviews, business and add a little at a time (start with a fraction of a capsule)
		2. dont combine supplements without testing incrementally (start with small doses & minimal combinations, like starting with one at a time)
		3. dont take more than a few supplements at any time
		4. pick one supplement from the most important functions (diuretic, renoprotective, reduce creatinine, lower blood pressure) and try the supplements with multiple functions first, according to your symptoms & stage
		
			- example: 
				- resveratrol is renoprotective & lowers blood pressure
				- algae: boosts immune system & lowers blood pressure, but may increase creatinine levels, so avoid if your BUN/blood urea/blood creatinine is high or GFR is low
				- salvia: increases GFR, and anything that increases GFR may help reduce blood creatinine
				- arginine: may increase creatine, but may also help reduce blood ammonia
				- astragalus, goldenrod, horsetail, java, nettle, parsley, oregon grape, uva ursi, yohimbe, juniper may all be diuretics or have other useful functions, but they may also cause kidney damage in people who already have kidney damage/dysfunction
