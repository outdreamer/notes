- protocol

	1. when I had end-stage renal disease symptoms (side pain, nerve pain, heart failure & high blood pressure symptoms, closed/tight throat, headaches from toxins, etc), here's what helped:
		- chugging olive oil for most of my calories, otherwise eating 20 g protein or less per day, and staying under 1 g of salt, including a balance of potassium/magnesium anytime I ate salt, and no seasoning
		- intermittent fasting (eat all my calories at once, once per day)
		- taking omega 3-6-9 supplement from Now Foods (about 4 per day, before eating)
		- taking other supplements in point 2 below
		- taking a teaspoon of bcaa's before eating
		- taking coq10 with hawthorne
		- drinking water (nothing else, no flavored seltzer or anything)
		- rest
		- get enough calcium, potassium, magnesium, and folate (and avoid anything that would offset these, like how collagen can lead to too much calcium)
		- taking melatonin & taking no caffeine (to help reduce blood pressure)
		- other things that might help in small amounts if you have high blood pressure/heart failure, though I didn't take most of these at the time, except arginine & a multivitamin, and some of these will hurt your kidneys like berberine or cayenne/garlic:
		  - increase vasodilation (arginine => nitric oxide, vitamin c, parsley, ginger, fish oil, hibiscus, berberine)
		  - lower cholesterol (garlic, fiber, celery, lemon, onion, cayenne, coconut oil, green tea (ecgc), fenugreek, watermelon seeds - cucurbocitrin), avoid saturated/trans fat

	2. a general protocol that helped me:
		- reducing protein/salt/potassium/phosphorus
		- reducing creatinine-increasing substances (see below) & artificial substances
		- replacing protein with peptides, amino acids, or keto acids (in decreasing order of processing difficulty for kidneys)
		- amino acids: bcaa's, glutamine, nac, arginine, carnitine
		- coq10
		- magnesium/calcium to bind to phosphorus/oxalates, & balance sodium/potassium
		- vitamin d
		- enzymes before eating to reduce processing work a little
		- omega 3's
		- omega 6, specifically arachidonic acid, which is metabolized to PGH2 and then to prostaglandin e2, which may help regulate inflammation & repair kidney cells
			https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130416121748.htm
			- Fish oils provide alternative fatty acids to arachidonic acid. These acids can be turned into some anti-inflammatory prostacyclins by COX instead of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins
			  - prostacyclins include:
			    - prostaglandin I2, a known regulator of renal cortical blood flow, in addition to having anti-inflammatory effects and to protect against renal failure
		- water/rest

	- the following may have helped me either recover, prevent symptoms, or maintain state:
		- vitamin c & e
		- cinnamon
		- mllk thistle
		- quercetin
		- ecgc (green tea)

	- one of the following (or an accumulation of the protocol above, or a combination) helped me recover from damaged kidney & heart tissue as a result of heart failure, blood pressure problems, and lack of blood flow to the kidneys
		- carnosine
		- arginine
		- chitosan (with chromium)
		- fucoidan from bladderwrack
		- salvia

	- if you want to add as few supplements as possible while maximizing benefits, Id add arginine, & coq10 & a omega 3-6-9 supplement like fish oil

	- regulate your blood pressure or your kidneys wont be able to heal

	- risk of cardiovascular events was increased in both the group with the highest & lowest protein intake

	- avoid excessive oxalates (collagen), which can lead to conditions like hypercalcemia

	- keep your cholesterol low
		- cholesterol-lowering supplements
		  - plant sterols
		  - beta-glucans
		  - bergamot orange
		  - garlic
		  - lycopene
		  - glucomannan
		  - green tea polyphenols
		  - olive leaf extracts
		  - red yeast rice

- key questions

	- what are the ratios to maintain (amino acid, electrolyte, nutrient, calorie intake, vitamin, binders, rest vs. exercise, eating vs. fasting, hormone ratios)
	- what causal structures are relevant (kidney-metabolic-heart inter-connected, multi-directional causal loop, where each can cause the other)
	- what points, states, paths, & boundaries in the interaction space lead to recovery vs. progression
	- what are the required functions for recovery/prevention/maintenance (filtration, circulation, fluid/blood pressure regulation)
	- what causal degree can be targeted (amino acid vs. peptide vs. protein, inputs/requiremnts/precursors to problematic substances/processes)

- kidney damage symptom causes:

	- muscle weakness: fluid & electrolyte imbalance
	- chest pain: inflammation of heart lining 
	- lung pain: fluid buildup 
	- kidney pain: kidneys may experience pain if there is a stone present, if they are infected or if they are blocked

- kidney damage causes

	- blood flow to your kidneys is blocked or slowed
		- dehydration, blood pressure problems, infection & liver failure can cause this 

	- direct damage to your kidneys
		- inflammation of glomeruli
		- blood clots
		- high cholesterol/deposits
		- destruction of red blood cells causing Hemolytic uremic syndrome
		- lupus
		- medications/toxins
		- Muscle tissue breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) or tumor lysis

	- kidney urine drainage tubes (ureters) become blocked and wastes cant leave your body through your urine
		- cancer
		- nerve damage
		- urinary blood clots
		- kidney stones


- kidney damage complications
	- progression
		- uremia
		- conditions from low/high electrolytes (hypomagnesia/hypokalemia)
			- hyperparathyroidism caused by high calcium
		- kidney stones
		- lack of blood flow to kidneys, leading to damaged tissue
	- blood pressure disregulation
		- heart disease
	- lack of blood sugar control
		- hypoglycemia


- nutrition

	- nutritional requirements

		- Acute renal failure
		  Calories: 20-35 kcal/kg = 1000
		  Protein: 0.6-0.8 g/kg if not receiving dialysis = 30 g 

		- low calorie diet for renal damage repair
			- VLCKD is a nutritional protocol that resembles fasting through a marked restriction of daily carbohydrate intake, usually lower than 30 g/day (≃ 13% of total energy intake) along with a relative increase in the proportions of fat (≃ 44%) and protein (≃ 43%) and a total daily energy intake < 800 kcal

	- avoid:
		- any artificial substances, which will get in your blood and may not get filtered out by your damaged filtration organs, which may cause structural damage & mutations leading to cancer
		- histidine & angiotensin 11 receptor blockers, regarding glomerulonephritis
			- Angiotensin_II_receptor_blockers reduce kidney function in the form of reducing glomerular repair
			- Angiotensin_II_receptor_blocker share a imidazole component with histidine
		- acidic foods: meat, fish, dairy, egg yolk, nuts, grains, carbonated drinks

	- avoid excessive:
	    - sodium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium	
	    	- excess phosphate can cause low calcium levels, which can result in muscle spasms
	    - choline 
	    - arginine
	    - aspirin, nsaids
	    - blood thinners or interactive supplements (garlic, saw palmetto)
	    - saturated fat/cholesterol/salt
	    - stevia: acceptable daily intake for stevia glycosides is 4 milligrams (mg) per kilogram of body weight (1 tsp max)
	    - high potassium herbs:
	      - alfalfa, dandelion, garlic, lemongrass, nettle, turmeric
	    - high phosphorus herbs:
	      - flax, milk thistle, onion, nettle, turmeric, sunflower
	    - avoid with kidney disease:
	      - astragalus, goldenrod, horsetail, java, nettle, oregon grape, parsley, uva ursi, yohimbe, juniper
	    - oxalate
	    	- high oxalate: nuts, chocolate, soy, beans, starchy vegetables, & greens
			- low oxalate: mushrooms, cucumbers, celery, iceberg lettuce & cauliflower

	      - foods like meat, dairy, chocolate, nuts, soy, eggs, seaweed, spirulina, & gelatin will raise creatinine
	      - The amino acids methionine, arginine, & glycine are processed in the kidneys to produce guanidinoacetic acid, which is then sent to the liver where it is converted to another amino acid called creatine. Creatinine is a waste byproduct of metabolizing creatine
	    	- try: cucumber 

	  - reduce bun level: 
	  	- Polyenylphosphatidycholine (egg/soy, alternative version in lecithin)

	  - reduce blood ammonia
	    - kidneys cannot easily remove excess water, salt, or potassium from the blood
		  - Low protein diets, are intended to minimize production of ammonia. Arginine, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate help to remove ammonia from the blood. 
		    Sodium phenylbutyrate metabolites allows the kidneys to excrete excess nitrogen in place of urea, and coupled with dialysis, amino acid supplements and a protein-restricted diet
		    Phenylacetate is produced from bacterial degradation of unabsorbed phenylalanine (soybeans)
		    Dialysis may be used to remove ammonia from the blood when it reaches critical levels

		- avoid valproic acid
			- Inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) like valproic acid have anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects
			- valproic acid before kidney injury prevented the development of proteinuria and the onset of glomerulosclerosis. 
	    	- Even after postponing treatment until the peak of adriamycin-induced proteinuria, valproic acid rapidly decreased the quantity of proteinuria and attenuated the progression of renal disease. 
			- Valproic acid abrogated the decrease in glomerular acetylation observed during adriamycin-induced nephropathy. 
			- Furthermore, valproic acid attenuated the significant upregulation of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes, the deposition of collagen, and the infiltration of macrophages into the kidney
			- vitamin u (counters valproic acid)
			  - Collectively, these data show that VPA is a promoter of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis which resulted in renal damage. Vit U can be proposed as a potential candidate for preventing renal damage which arose during the therapeutic usage of VPA.

		- amino acids

			- possibly helpful to kidney function: branch chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine), glutamine, arginine
			- possibly harmful to kidney function: glycine, arginine, methionine
			- ketoanalogues of essential amino-acids (with nitrogen removed from amino acids, to further reduce work for kidneys)
			- amino acids may help regulate blood sugar, help recovery, improve muscle function
			- L-histidine may help with chronic kidney failure

			- the amino acid ratio is important to get right:
				- kidney damage patients may be low in BCAA's so supplementation may help prevent deficiency & related conditions (hypoalbuminemia)
				- excess glutamine may reduce usage of other amino acids: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22990615/
				- lowering your methionine intake may enable other functions like recovery: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29943496/

			- getting essential amino acids
				- complete proteins: Soy, Amaranth, quinoa, hempseed, and chia
				- If you only eat grains and cereals, you wont get enough lysine; legumes such as peanuts, peas, dry beans and lentils contain a lot of lysine. 
				- Legumes arent good sources of tryptophan, methionine, and cystine, but grains and cereals are. (Grains or nuts) & legumes are complementary proteins

			- a-keto acids, by-products of amino acids: 
				- oxaloacetate
				- citrate
				- isocitrate
				- a-ketoglutarate
				- succinyl coenzyme A
				- succinate
				- fumarate
				- malate

			  - methionine
			  - phenylalanine (soy)
			  - threonine (lentils, sesame)
			  - tryptophan (spirulina, soy, sesame, sunflower)
			  - valine

			- Conditionally essential:
			  - arginine
			  	- synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline
			  	- required to produce nitric oxide which may damage tissues
			  	- useful with renal ablation, ureteral obstruction, nephropathy secondary to diabetes, and salt-sensitive hypertension, attenuating the symptoms of preeclampsia, protective in ischemic acute renal failure
			  	- harmful in glomerulonephritis
			  - cysteine
			  - glutamine
			  	- glutamine supplementation in healthy athletes were associated with no significant adverse effects, but it can cause glomerulosclerosis and serum creatinine level elevation in the setting of diabetic nephropathy
			  - glycine (sesame, soy, pumpkin, nuts)
			  - proline
			  	- produced from arginine
			  - tyrosine

			- Non-essential:
			  - alanine 
			  - aspartic acid 
			  - asparagine
			  - - glutamic acid
			  - serine
			  - selenocysteine
			  - pyrrolysine

		- water fasting

			  - blood pressure
			  - oxidative stress
			  - mitochondrial dysfunction
			  - fibrosis
			  - preserves redox status and mitochondrial homeostasis at the chronic phase of damage after severe ischemia

- symptoms of kidney damage cause types: https://www.aafp.org/afp/2012/1001/p631.html

	- symptoms of related conditions

	  - hypercalcemia symptoms:
	    - weakness and fatigue, depression, bone pain, muscle soreness (myalgias), decreased appetite, feelings of nausea and vomiting, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, cognitive impairment, kidney stones ([nb 1]) and osteopenia or osteoporosis

	  - hypocalcemia symptoms:

	    - Petechiae which appear as on-off spots, then later become confluent, and appear as purpura (larger bruised areas, usually in dependent regions of the body).[citation needed]
	    - Oral, perioral and acral paresthesias, tingling or 'pins and needles' sensation in and around the mouth and lips, and in the extremities of the hands and feet. This is often the earliest symptom of hypocalcaemia.

- general symptoms

    Fluid buildup. Acute kidney failure can sometimes cause a buildup of fluid in your body. If fluid builds up in your lungs, this can cause shortness of breath.
	Chest pain. If the lining that covers your heart  becomes inflamed, you may have chest pain.
	Acidic blood (metabolic acidosis). If your blood has too much acid due to acute kidney failure, you can end up with nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and breathlessness.
	Muscle weakness. When your body's fluids and electrolytes are out of balance, you can get  muscle weakness.  In serious cases, this can lead to paralysis and heart rhythm problems.
    Lethargy
    Weakness
    Shortness of breath
    Generalized swelling (edema)
    Generalized weakness due to anemia
    Loss of appetite
    Lethargy

- test metrics

	- BUN is an indication of renal (kidney) health. The normal range is 2.1–7.1 mmol/L or 6–20 mg/dL.
    - Creatinine is a waste product in your blood that’s made by muscle activity. Normally, it’s removed from your blood by your kidneys. But if your kidneys stop working, your creatinine level rises.
    - Urea nitrogen is another waste product in your blood. It’s created when protein from the foods is broken down. Like creatinine, your kidneys remove this from your blood. When your kidneys stop working, your urea nitrogen levels rise.
    - Serum potassium is a substance found in your blood that balances water levels in your bloodstream. Kidney disease can cause either high or low potassium levels. 
    - Serum sodium is another substance in your blood that helps with fluid balance in your body.  High sodium levels can mean that your kidneys aren’t working properly because your body can’t get rid of the right amount of sodium.
  	- A high urine pH may be due to: Kidneys that do not properly remove acids (kidney tubular acidosis, also known as renal tubular acidosis)
  	- microalbumin: blood in urine, hematuria
  	- High urine specific gravity can indicate that you have extra substances in your urine, such as: glucose. protein. bilirubin. red blood cells. white blood cells. crystals. bacteria.

  	- how to measure metrics
  		- urine test strips
			- if you have a kidney problem, there will be higher levels of urea, creatinine, and potassium in your urine 
			- you may also have high blood pressure or changes in red blood cell count and calcium levels

			- caffeine or ketones could cause pee to smell like popcorn 
			- ketones cause the fruity smell, which indicates acids in the blood (ketoacidosis)
			- measures:
				1. Leukocytes – Presence of bacteria & Urinary Tract Infection
				2. Nitrite – Indicator of Urinary Tract Infection
				3. Urobilinogen – Indicator of liver issues
				4. Protein – Indicator of kidney issues
				5. pH – Acidic / alkaline levels in urine
				6. Blood – Indicator of kidney stones
				7. Specific Gravity – Efficiency of kidney filtering / Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
				8. Ketone – Indicator of diabetes / ketosis / acetoacetic level in urine
				9. Bilirubin – Indicator of liver / gallbladder issues
				10. Glucose – Indicator of diabetes (sugar in urine)
				11. Ascorbate – Amount of vitamin C in urine
				12. Micro-albumin – Indicator of kidney issues
				13. Creatinine – Indicator of Kidney issues
				14. Calcium – Indicator of Heart, Kidney & Thyroid issues
