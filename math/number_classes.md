Quantity: number

Quality: property; differentiating/identifying behavior or characteristic, indicating membership of a type; 
	patterns or subsets that apply to an object

Real numbers: describable as a section of a line, can be used to measure quantities, like 1 or 3/4;
	anything with a describable attribute beyond just a position

Rational numbers: any number that can be compressed to a fraction of two integers (1, 2, 3); a description 
	representable as a simple relationship between two known descriptions

Irrational numbers: any number that cant be compressed to a fraction of integers; the ratio between numbers
	that are reducible to different units, as opposed to rational numbers, which are ratios between 
	numbers that are reducible to the unit of 1 (integers)

Imaginary numbers: can be used to describe potential, bc theyre only understandable in reference to something 
	real & certain, such as the mirror image of a system that follows the rules of real numbers;
	the smallest unit of an unproven theory; representing the traces left by patterns we dont understand 
	because we havent yet encoded those patterns in human-comprehensible descriptions (numbers, networks, 
	spectrums, shapes)

	Square root: the number of units of one side of a square comprising the original number of units, 
	determined by the intersection of the attributes angle (90 degrees) & length (square root) in 3d space

	Imaginary unit: the opposite of the square root of 1 (the square root of -1), so imaginary numbers 
	are the opposite of the intersection of the attributes angle & length in 3d space

	For example it might be the intersection of the rules generating 3d space, the intersection of axes in a 
	space, the degree of divergence between angle & length when graphed in a vector space to describe the 
	behavior of those attributes across all shapes, etc

Complex number: a real number combined with an imaginary number; a mix of certainty & uncertainty, 
	like applying a strategy that is proven optimal in one problem type to a new problem type

Algebraic number: a complex number that is a root of a polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients 
	
	Roots: values which cause a polynomial to equal 0; the root is a value that will undo the polynomial 
	set of operations & values leading away from the origin value of 0, like a description that gives you 
	enough information to derive the shape (or shape type) that it describes

	Polynomials: a set of +, -, x & integer power operations on variables & their coefficients (multipliers)

Transcendental numbers: a complex number that is not a root of a polynomial; transcendentals cannot be a
	compressed description of a polynomial relationship like algebraic numbers, because they are the key 
	constants describing the abstract network of systems, keeping everything in its functional place;
	they dont describe polynomial relationships, they shape the network of systems in a way that allows 
	the polynomial relationships to work

	In this universe, our laws of physics are tuned with a transcendental parameter equal to e, Ï€, etc.
