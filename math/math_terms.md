# Math terms

## Standard terms


### Math field terms

	- geometry: study of structure
	- algebra: study of mathematical relationships
	- Hilbert's Nullstellensatz: establishes link between geometry & algebra, forming the basis of algebraic geometry, specifically relating algebraic sets to ideals in polynomial rings over algebraically closed fields

	- representation theory
		- represents elements of algebraic structures as linear transformations of vector spaces & studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures
		- a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices & its algebraic operations (for example, matrix addition, matrix multiplication)
		- reduces problems in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra

	- representation space: executing linear transforms on vector spaces to represent algebraic structure elements

	- functional analysis

		- study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure (inner product, norm, topology, etc.) and the linear functions defined on these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense
		- the study of function spaces & function property transformations
		- study of vector spaces having a topology, in spaces possibly having infinite dimensions (where linear algebra doesnt use a topology & covers mostly finite-dimensions)

		- infinite dimensional analysis: extension of functional analysis with measuring, integrating, and assessing probability in infinite dimensional spaces


### Algebra/Geometry

	- natural log:
		- area under the curve y = 1/x from 1 to a
		- ln x = e^y = x (how many times do you multiply e by itself to get x)

	- series/progression:

	- algebraic variety: set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations

	- discriminant: 
		- example of calculating properties of solution without calculating solution directly
		- can tell if solution sub-components (roots) are equal, signed, etc by calculating value of discriminant which is a function of polynomial coefficients


### Stats

	- errors

	    - bias error (missing features) is from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm
	    	- high bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features & target outputs (underfitting)

	    - variance error (doesnt generalize well) is from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set
	    	- high variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended outputs (overfitting)

	- questions

	- operation intents

		- standardize:
			- compare
			- differentiate
			- classify
			- equate

		- scale: 
			- standardize (if less than one)
			- identify (if equal to one)
			- create base for change (if greater than one, which expands it by a dimension)

		- average:
			- find a base value
			- compare

	- insights

		- why choosing one measurement isnt always optimal

			- if you were deciding between using half & square root as a measurement of an area, using the insight 'find the base/unit example' might lead you to believe there were no gains to either or that they were interchangeable, bc the square root of 1, 2, 3, 4 and half of 1, 2, 3, 4 are similar enough for their differences to seem irrelevant

		- why operations arent possible with certain information formats (like assigning a number to categories):
			- it loses information needed to differentiate positions & define an addition/combination operation (like a standard definition such as 'combining attributes & removing duplicates')

	- definitions

		- skew is unequal tails
			- standard definition: position of mean
		
		- kurtosis is extremity of deviations/outliers (like fat tails), having a value of 3 for the normal distribution
			- standard definition: deviation from random variable base (equal distribution across possible outcomes)
		
		- variance is expectation of the standard deviation of a random variable from its mean (how spread out values are from average, or collective deviation from mean)
			- standard definition: centralization of change

		- degrees of freedom: 
			- a single scalar numerical independent parameter indicating the dimensions of a system's phase space (the set of all possible system states)
			- standard movement in 3d space requires 3 position params & 3 velocity params describing speed & direction 

	- you can generate the moments by combining attributes (position, centrality, range) & functions (average, standard) & objects (base implementing a random/equal distribution across outcome probabilities), building on a key metric like the mean, and filtering the combinations by which describe different change/difference types

	- other metrics include:
		- position in relation to other distributions
		- determining tangent intersections
		- bases
		- initial value (was the initial value of this variable when the variable first began to change nearer to a particular metric like the average)


### Space

	- space: a network of objects with defined functions linking them & operations that can be done on the objects - a set with some added structure

				- base (subset of elements) can be used to generate a topology on a set
				- weight of the topological space: smallest cardinality of a base

				- use cases:
					- used to display configurations (attribute value combinations of an object), or sets (vectors, networks, spaces, function sets) as a point
				
				- topology types:
					- metric topology: the topology generated by a collection of open balls
					- discrete topology has the singletons as a base
					- order topology: the topology generated by a collection of open-interval-like sets
				    - metric spaces
				    	- metric: a precise notion of distance between points
				    - proximity spaces

				- generalizes euclidean space properties
				- an affine space has no origin so no vector can be associated to a point
				- an affine space consists of displacement vectors, indicating translations to get from one point to another, & which can be added to a point
				- any vector space may be represented as an affine space

	- quaternions: ratio of two vectors: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion

	- image of a function: set of all output values a function can produce


#### Vectors

	- vector:

	- spinor:
		- elements of a complex vector space that can be associated with Euclidean space
		- like geometric vectors & tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to an incremental rotation
		- when a sequence of such small rotations is composed to form a final rotation, the resulting spinor transformation depends on which sequence of small rotations was used
		- unlike vectors and tensors, a spinor transforms to its negative when the space is continuously rotated through a complete turn from 0° to 360° 
		- spinors can be viewed as the "square roots" of vectors
		- lends an attribute of adjacence to otherwise opposing values, crystallizing the concept of a shortcut (a metadata hack) to an operation
	
	- base: 
		- a collection of subsets of a space/set
	- span:

	- vector space V quotient by a subspace N (V/N): a vector space produced by collapsing N to 0

	- cokernel: 
		- partition of algebraic structure elements using a congruence relation
		- the cokernel of a linear mapping f between vector spaces X -> Y is the quotient space (Y / im(f)) of f's codomain (output space) by f's image
		- the dimension of the cokernel is the corank of f
		- cokernels correspond to the kernels in that the kernel is a subobject of the domain, while the cokernel is a quotient object of the codomain
		- measures the constraints of y in order for f(x) = y to have a solution (solution filters)
		- kernel measures the solution's degrees of freedom if one exists

		- for abelian groups/vector spaces/modules, the cokernel of the homomorphism f = the quotient of Y by the image of f
