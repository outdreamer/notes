# Math terms


## Group theory

  - structures to examine:

    - rings for interface network
    - algebras for vertices of a problem space


## Attributes

	- span of two vectors is the range of their scaled addition = linear combination of vectors

			if one vector is linearly dependent on the other (can be produced as a linear combination of the others), it's redundant & doesnt add to the span
		- basis of a space: the set of linearly independent vectors that span that space
		- basis vectors i-hat & j-hat are unit vectors of two dimensions x & y
			column 1 = coordinates where i-hat lands
			column 2 = coordinates where j-hat lands
		- transformations keep lines parallel and evenly spaced, and origin is fixed
		- matrix multiplication is applying two transformations, starting from the right side
		- determinant is volume of parallelipiped space created by the vectors

	- degrees of freedom: dimensions of phase space including all possible states of a physical system 

	- jacobi identity: a property of binary operations describing impact of order of operations

	- distance
	- uniqueness
	- equivalence (homeomorphism)
	- intersection (tangent, overlap, collision, cooperation, etc)
	- homogeneity
	- isotropic	
	- continuity
	- convergence
	- connectedness
	- infinity
	- adjacency
	- cooperation (objects/types/attributes)
	- scale


## Types

	- types are determined by sets of attributes (continuous, host system, reversibility, combinability, measurability)

	- number types
	- data types
	- variable types


## Core Shapes

	- line
	- angle
	- vector
	- tensor
	- set
	- unit
	- map
	- value
	- boundary

	- algebraic structures: a group of operations having finite inputs on a set (the algebra refers to the set itself being operated on)

		- groups: 

			- group: 
				- set including a binary operation that combines any two elements to make a third element that satisfies:

			- closure (operation on a member of the set produces a member of the set
			- associativity: independence of order property
			- identity: identity element leaves any element unchanged when combined with it
			- invertibility: reversibility
			- abelian group: commutative group where applying the group operation to two group elements doesnt depend on order of operation
			- related concepts:
				- symmetry
			- a symmetry group: the set of operations that leave an object unchanged
			
			- a lie group: 
				- a continuous group described by several real parameters that is a differentiable manifold, with smooth group operations
				- used for modeling continuous symmetry, like symmetry of rotating a sphere in three dimensions
				- originally used to model continuous symmetries of differential equations
				- a representation of a Lie group: a linear action of a Lie group on a vector space; a smooth homomorphism of the group into the group of invertible operators on the vector space
				- examples: 
					- orthogonal groups:
					- unitary groups:
				- lie algebra: a vector space with a non-associative operation called the lie bracket (an alternating bilinear map satisfying the jacobi order of operations identity)
			
			- finite group:
				- used in galois theory to model discrete symmetries of algebraic equations 

		- rings: 
			- ring: set including two binary operations generalizing addition & multiplication
			- rings are also abelian groups with an additional binary operation that is associative & distributive over the abelian group operation, & has an identity element
			- associative & distributive second binary operation
			- identity

		- fields: 
			- field: a set on which addition, subtraction, division, & multiplication are defined & these operations behave like the corresponding operations do in the fields of real & rational numbers
			field extension: relationship between fields such that the operations of a subfield are the operations of the extended field, retricted to the subfield
			examples: field of real numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers

		- lattice: 

	- categories: 
		- category: a collection of objects linked by arrows, having two basic properties: 
		- the ability to compose the arrows associatively
		- the existence of an identity arrow for each object
		- example: a simple example is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions 

	- series:

	- matrix:

	- lagrangian: 

    - quaternions: 
      - ratio of two vectors: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion
      - quaternion number system is a associative, non-commutative division algebra over real numbers
     

## Functions

	- types:

		- injective function: one-to-one function

		- differential equation: a function linking a function & its rates of change
			- types: Ordinary/Partial, Linear/Non-linear, and Homogeneous/heterogeneous

		- polynomial:

		- homomorphism: a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type

		- homeomorphism: a continuous function linking topological spaces that preserves the properties of each space & the inverse function is also continuous

			- continuous deformation arent always homeomorphisms (deforming a line into a point)
			- some homeomorphisms arent continuous deformations

		- immersion: a differentiable function between two differentiable manifolds whose derivative is injective (1-to-1)


	- intents:

		- decompositions/alternate forms
		- description methods/minimum of information
		- function conversion methods
		- proofs
			- rule of replacement (associativity/distributivity)


## Spaces

    - algebra: 

     	- vector space with a (bilinear) way to multiply two vectors in two vector spaces, like a set with a set of supported operations

	- hilbert space: 

		- generalization of euclidean space, extending vector algebra & calculus methods to infinite dimensions

	- affine space: 

		- a structure that generalizes euclidean space properties 

		- removes the concept of distance & angle measure but keeps the parallelism & ratio of lengths for parallel line segments
		- an affine space has no origin so no vector can be associated to a point
		- an affine space consists of displacement vectors, indicating translations to get from one point to another, & which can be added to a point
		- any vector space may be represented as an affine space

		- affine transformation: a function between affine spaces which preserves points, straight lines and planes

			- sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation
			- an affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, 
			though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line

			- examples: translation, scaling, homothety, similarity transformation, reflection, rotation, shear mapping, and compositions of them in any combination & sequence

	- topological space: 

		- a set of points & neighborhoods for each point with axioms relating neighborhoods & points

		- sufficiently general to allow properties:

			- continuity
			- convergence
			- connectedness

		- examples of topological spaces:

			- metric space: a set & a metric function on the set (example: euclidean space where the metric is the distance of the straight line connecting two points)

	- manifold: 

		- an n-dimensional space where the locality of each point represents a homeomorphism euclidean space of dimension n

Notes:

- problem solving automater
	dependencies:
	- insight filter ("extract insight from data, selecting for variance cascades")
	- pattern finder ("find a pattern with intent x or output y")
	- pattern generator ("generate probable patterns using known or likely components to explain x")
	- pattern applier ("apply this pattern to this system", "apply this insight to this solution")
		- concept combiner ("combine this strategy with this power balance")
	- selecting strategies
	- property matching for sub-intents of exploit intent 
	- perspective switching/transforms

- industry tech combinations
	risk analysis (finance, insurance)
	science
	statistics
	machine learning
	information tech
	quantum
	computing

	- when these combinations have been exhausted with normal methods of value creation (automation, standardization, combination, platform, search, metadata), 
		there will be a phase shift in the direction of the variance/vulnerabilities of the last combination 
	- can you derive the order each component combination will happen in?
	- the main concern is whether there will be safeguards to control the last combination's potential exploits, or whether any safeguards will be invalidated by prior tools



Here's a thought "CJ" - if Facebook leaves me alone, 
I will stop inventing things that invalidate their business and/or invent new laws or legal systems in which their business cannot survive.
Ok? Yay you had a thought, but I had to put it there first.

Actually now it's clear 100% of my coworkers would also try to kill me so they're no better than any other tech employees.
